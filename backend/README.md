# Full Stack Trivia API Backend

## Getting Started by Installing Dependencies

### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup
With Postgres running, create a database named 'trivia' and restore the database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```
After restoring the database, you need to specify the logging to the database in `backend/models.py`. change the username and password. 
```python
database_name = "trivia"
username = 'postgres'
password = '123456'
database_path = "postgres://{}:{}@{}/{}".format(username,password,'localhost:5432', database_name)
```

## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.<br>
To run the server, in **LINUX** environment execute:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
In **WINDOWS** Environment, use the following commands to run the server:
```cmd
set FLASK_APP=flaskr
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.<br>
Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. <br>
**NOTE**: Everytime you restart the console, the above commands need to be executed.

## Test the API
To run the tests, run
```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
